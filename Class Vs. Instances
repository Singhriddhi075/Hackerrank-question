Write a Person class with an instance variable, age , and a constructor that takes an integer,initial age , as a parameter.
The constructor must assign initialAge to age  after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; 
if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set Age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the age  instance variable by 1.
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If age<13 , print You are young..
If age>=13 and age<18, print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..


import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Person {
    private int age;	
    public Person(int initialAge) {
          if(initialAge < 0){
            age = 0;
            System.out.println("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.");
        }else{
            age = initialAge;
        }
    }

    public void amIOld() {
        String ans;
          if(age < 13){
            ans = "You are young.";
        }else if(age >= 13 && age < 18){
            ans = "You are a teenager.";
        }else{
            ans = "You are old.";
        }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }

    public void yearPasses() {
          age += 1;
    }
  
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int T = sc.nextInt();
		for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) {
			int age = sc.nextInt();
			Person p = new Person(age);
			p.amIOld();
			for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
				p.yearPasses();
			}
			p.amIOld();
			System.out.println();
        }
		sc.close();
    }
}
