Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i,d ,s and  are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

1.Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2.Read 3  lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
3.Use + the  operator to perform the following operations:
1.Print i the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
2.Print d the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
3.Concatenate s  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
